# List of Task
1. [DONE] Add the other modules from README.md.
2. [DONE] The pop up of definition and function of the chosen module will appear in module section covering the whole section when you click the module using mouse or tap the module using the touchscreen that you could close anytime.
4. [DONE] Make the pop up position fixed to all module when you click or tap any modules.
5. [TODO] Modify the Simulation Section. Each module will be recognized as either signal sender, processor, and reciever. Sensory Integrator might be considered as the sender, Decision engine might be considered as the reciever of the signals ready for executions, and the rest module could be a processor of Signals. You could modify its function if my understanding is wrong. Required: a. Dataset of Modules function: It will contain what module it will allowed to connect and the order or connection because for example, the sensory integrator module is allowed to connect to memory bank and vision sensor. If the 3 module exist the order of connections is Sensory Integrator to Vision Sensor to Memory Bank, but if only sensory integrator and memory bank exist, the connection will be Sensory Integrator to Memory Bank. Visual Behavior: after the module is dragged to the simulator, when the run simualtor will click or tap, the connection will be activated which is already an existing feature - a line connecting to each module. The additional feature is, there should be a white small circles running in the connection line from sender module to processor module to reciever module whoever exist.
6. [TODO] Add a feature to the simulation that allows users to save and load module configurations. This feature should include: a. A "Save Configuration" button that saves the current module setup to local storage. b. A "Load Configuration" button that retrieves the saved setup and restores it in the simulation. c. Ensure that connections between modules are also saved and restored correctly.

5. [PROCESSING] Modify the Simulation Section. Each module will be recognized as either signal sender, processor, and receiver...] Lets update the brhavior or simulator. The speed of the white circles traveling the connection line should depend with the Processing speed value. The Higher the Value , the faster the movement of the white circles. The count of whitr circles passing at the same time will depend on the memory size, the higher the number, the more white circles are passing in the line next to each other at the same time. The complexity size will affect the number of connections to the modules. Higher complexity will give a more connection to each modules with each other. The simulator should be affected when the sliding bar will be adjust while the simulation is running.
