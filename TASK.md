# List of Task
1. [DONE] Update the README.md. Keep the content the same but remove the duplicate.
2. [DONE] Add more reasonable modules that we ussually used each day. put a 3 dot near the title of module section that if you click it, a pop up will appear containing the definition and function of each module.
3. [DONE] Remove the 3 dot next to the module section title.
4. [DONE] The pop up of definition and function of the chosen module will appear in module section covering the whole section when you click the module using mouse or tap the module using the touchscreen.
5. [DONE] The pop up didn't appear at the top of the modules, it instead appear at the most buttom of the page. Please transfer it near the module, it may be like a pop up box that cover the screen or atleast next to module section that you could close anytime.
6. [DONE] Nice one. The Pop Up decribed in task 5 is really implemented. But can you just change a little bit the possition? make it a little lower just in the location where the module buttons is located.
7. [DONE] Can you make the position of the pop up fixed to all when you click or tap any modules. The position will be same as you click the Memory Bank Module.
8. [DONE] Modify the Simulation Section. Each module will be recognized as either signal sender, processor, and reciever. Sensory Integrator might be considered as the sender, Decision engine might be considered as the reciever of the signals ready for executions, and the rest module could be a processor of Signals. You could modify its function if my understanding is wrong. Required: a. Dataset of Modules function: It will contain what module it will allowed to connect and the order or connection because for example, the sensory integrator module is allowed to connect to memory bank and vision sensor. If the 3 module exist the order of connections is Sensory Integrator to Vision Sensor to Memory Bank, but if only sensory integrator and memory bank exist, the connection will be Sensory Integrator to Memory Bank. Visual Behavior: after the module is dragged to the simulator, when the run simualtor will click or tap, the connection will be activated which is already an existing feature - a line connecting to each module. The additional feature is, there should be a white small circles running in the connection line from sender module to processor module to reciever module whoever exist.
9. [DONE] Add a feature to the simulation that allows users to save and load module configurations. This feature should include: a. A "Save Configuration" button that saves the current module setup to local storaggit revert HEAD~3..HEADe. b. A "Load Configuration" button that retrieves the saved setup and restores it in the simulation. c. Ensure that connections between modules are also saved and restored correctly.
10. [DONE] Update the module types in the README.md
11. [DONE] Lets update the brhavior or simulator. The speed of the white circles traveling the connection line should depend with the Processing speed value. The Higher the Value , the faster the movement of the white circles. The count of whitr circles passing at the same time will depend on the memory size, the higher the number, the more white circles are passing in the line next to each other at the same time. The complexity size will affect the number of connections to the modules. Higher complexity will give a more connection to each modules with each other. The simulator should be affected when the sliding bar will be adjust while the simulation is running.
