# List of Task
1. [DONE] Add the other modules from README.md.
2. [DONE] The pop up of definition and function of the chosen module will appear in module section covering the whole section when you click the module using mouse or tap the module using the touchscreen that you could close anytime.
4. [DONE]] Make the pop up position fixed to all module when you click or tap any modules.
5. [DONE] Modify the Simulation Section. Each module will be recognized as either signal sender, processor, and receiver...
6. [DONE] Lets update the behavior of the simulator. The speed of the glowing small circles traveling the connection line should depend with the Processing speed value. The Higher the Value , the faster the movement of the white circles.
7. [DONE] The count of glowing small circles passing at the same time will depend on the memory size, the higher the number, the small circles are passing in the line next to each other at the same time.
8. [DONE] The complexity size will affect the number of connections to the modules. Higher complexity will give a more connection to each modules with each other.
9. [DONE] The simulator should be affected when the sliding bar will be adjust while the simulation is running.
